My name is David (@davdsb) and my github is mainly focused on Data Visualisation, Image Processing and the mixture of the two.
I'm interested in implementing complex data processing while maintaning as much visibility as I can to the user via UI.
The main idea is to create flexible UIs to customize the process while also being responsive so the the UI will reflects the process in real time.

I use to rely on C#/WPF because of the flexibily WPF provides and the elegance I found in MVVM development which it induce. But I've started using Linux in my day-to-day work, and WPF is only fully supported inWindows, so now I'm getting familliar with Dear ImGui. I find its simplicity relaxing and it also allow me to code all my process in C++, which I prefere in many cases (OpenCV is not well supported in C# afaik).

I haven't collaborated seriously on any repository, and I intend to change that.

Programming languages don't scares me, I mostly use C#, C++ and Python, but I'm familliar with Java, JavaScript, TS, HTML and more.
